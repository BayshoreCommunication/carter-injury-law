<p className="text-base md:text-lg">
At nursing homes, physical abuse occurs when residents are harmed by deliberate force or rough handling, such as hitting, slapping, or improper restraint. Florida law enforces that nursing homes provide care safely and respectfully. Violating these duties, resulting in physical harm is grounds for legal action.

<p className="text-base md:text-lg">
In nursing homes, neglect and abandonment mean that residents don’t receive the necessary care or supervision they need. Neglect includes failure to provide food, water, medication, hygiene, or mobility assistance, while abandonment involves leaving a resident unattended for extended periods, creating dangerous situations - even life risk. Florida law mandates that nursing homes provide adequate care.

Florida law requires nursing homes to protect residents from all forms of abuse and maintain proper safety measures. When sexual abuse occurs, those responsible—individuals or the facility—can be held legally accountable.
