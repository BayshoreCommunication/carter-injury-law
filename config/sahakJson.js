Medication errors happen when a healthcare provider prescribes or administers the wrong medication, dosage, or fails to account for potential drug interactions. This can result in harm to the patient. These errors can occur in hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacies, and clinics. In Florida, under §95.11(5) you have 2 years from the date the error was discovered or should have been discovered with due diligence. This period can extend up to 4 years from the date of the incident, but not later than.

Surgical errors occur when a mistake during surgery causes harm to a patient. These errors can include operating on the wrong body part, leaving surgical instruments inside the patient, or performing an unnecessary procedure. Florida Statute of Limitations § 95.11(5)(c) governs the timeframe for filing medical malpractice claims, including those arising from surgical errors. Generally, a plaintiff must file a lawsuit within 2 years of the date of the incident. Conversely, within 2 years of the date the injury was discovered or should have been discovered through reasonable diligence.

<p className="text-base md:text-lg">
In nursing homes, neglect and abandonment mean that residents don’t receive the necessary care or supervision they need. Neglect includes failure to provide food, water, medication, hygiene, or mobility assistance, while abandonment involves leaving a resident unattended for extended periods, creating dangerous situations - even life risk. Florida law mandates that nursing homes provide adequate care.

<p className="text-base md:text-lg">
Sexual abuse in nursing homes involves unwanted sexual contact or advances by staff, residents, or visitors. This abuse, whether physical, verbal, or emotional, often goes unreported due to victims' vulnerability. Florida law requires nursing homes to protect residents from all forms of abuse and maintain proper safety measures. When sexual abuse occurs, those responsible—individuals or the facility—can be held legally accountable.

Nursing home financial abuse occurs when a resident’s money or assets are misused or stolen by caregivers, staff, or other residents. This can involve unauthorized access to bank accounts, credit cards, and property, or compelling residents into financial decisions. Florida law treats financial exploitation seriously, requiring nursing homes to protect residents’ finances. When they fail, families can seek legal action to recover stolen funds and hold offenders accountable.
