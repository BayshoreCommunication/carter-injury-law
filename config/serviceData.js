                      Without a truck accident lawyer, victims of truck accidents in Tampa Bay can face significant challenges in navigating the complex regulations that govern commercial trucking.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg">Premise Liability Premises liability claims encompass a wide range of cases. If you’ve been injured on someone else’s property, you may be entitled to financial compensation if you can prove that the property owner somehow caused your injury and was negligent in doing so. Some examples of premises liability claims are slip and falls, trip and falls, dog bites, security that fails to protect you at a bar from another disorderly patron, or an overaggressive security person at a night club.</p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg">Evidence of a property owner’s negligence is especially important in a premises liability claim because the property owner may later deny they knew anything about the reason someone was hurt on the property. If you can, you should take photographs of the property and ask for the first and last name of the manager on duty. </p>

                An unexpected fall to a hard surface can cause significant
                injuries to a person’s body, bringing about medical bills, pain,
                suffering, and lost of the ability to earn a living. If you’ve
                slipped and fallen, or tripped and fallen, on someone else’s
                property, you may be entitled to financial compensation if you
                can prove that the property owner somehow failed to inspect the
                property or maintain it in a reasonably safe condition.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg">
                Some examples of slip/trip and falls are a slippery substance on
                the floor, uneven concrete, potholes in a parking lot, items
                left out in a store walkway, or even roots sticking up through a
                sidewalk. Evidence of a property owner’s negligence is
                especially important in a slip and fall claim because the
                property owner may later deny they knew anything about the
                dangerous condition that hurt someone. If you can, you should
                take photographs of the dangerous condition and ask for the
                first and last name of the manager on duty. An experienced

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg">A vicious dog can cause serious injury to a person that may result in hospitalization, the need for plastic surgery, or even death. Florida is a strict-liability dog bite state, meaning that you need not prove that a dog bit someone due to the negligence of the owner; you only need to prove that the dog owner actually owned the dog and that it bit you. There are narrow exceptions based on the types of signs that a dog owner posts on the property (if that is where the bite occurred) and the age of the person who was bitten (children and the elderly are especially vulnerable to dangerous dogs). </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg">Unfortunately, many homeowners’ insurance policies now specifically exclude coverage for losses sustained due to an animal, such as a dog that got out of the yard; however, the owner of that dog is still legally liable for the damage caused by a dog bite. If you’ve been bitten by someone else’s dog, you may be entitled to financial compensation. If you can, you should take photographs of the dog and the location where the bite occurred.</p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg">It is also important to report the dog bite to animal control so the proper steps can be taken to ensure that no one else is bitten by the dog. An experienced attorney can help prove your dog bite claim and potentially get you compensated for your loss. At Carter Injury Law, we have experience with these claims and will help collect evidence to prove your case and hold the dog owner responsible for your injuries. </p>
