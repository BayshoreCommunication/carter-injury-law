      "I have known David since law school. When I was in an accident, I called him because I knew I could trust him. David advised me every step of the way and I assure you, I asked a lot of questions. He made decisions that pressured the opposition, and helped me to achieve a great result. I thank him, and I would recommend him to my loved ones.",
