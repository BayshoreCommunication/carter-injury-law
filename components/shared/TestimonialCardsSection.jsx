      testimonial: "After a frustrating two-year experience with a large law firm that showed minimal communication or progress, switching to Carter Injury Law made an immediate difference. David and his team were responsive, compassionate, and actually cared about my case. Within just a few months, they accomplished more than the previous firm had in years. I highly recommend Carter Injury Law for anyone seeking a dedicated and effective legal team."
