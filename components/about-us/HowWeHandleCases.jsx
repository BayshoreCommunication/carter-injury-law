                  Our process begins with a thorough, cost-free initial
                  consultation with an attorney, not an intake sales team or a
                  case manager. We offer whatever works best for you, including
                  face-to-face, in-office meetings; travel to your home, the
                  hospital, or another comfortable public place; and virtual
                  consultations by ZOOM with a convenient all digital signup
                  which allows you to meet with us and retain our services all
                  from your cell phone, tablet, or computer. During this
                  meeting, we listen carefully to your story and strive to make
                  you feel comfortable and understood, ensuring you leave the
                  consultation with a clear understanding of the legal process
                  and confidence in our dedication to your case. We explain what
                  you can expect moving forward, including potential timelines,
                  legal fees, and our plan to achieve the best possible outcome.

                  Once you have agreed to have us represent you, your attorney
                  and our legal team begin gathering all necessary evidence,
                  including initial medical records, photographs/videos of the
                  vehicles or scene of the accident, accident/incident/crash
                  reports, witness statements, and any other relevant documents.
                  We may work with medical experts, accident reconstructionists,
                  and other professionals to build a strong, evidence-based case
                  to maximize your case outcome. Throughout this phase, we keep
                  you updated on progress and explain any developments. Client
                  communication is prioritized; we maintain regular check-ins so
                  you feel informed, valued, and assured that your case is

                  In personal injury cases, a comprehensive understanding of
                  your injuries and medical treatment is vital. We work closely
                  with you to document your injuries, losses, and medical
                  treatments accurately, as this information will be crucial for
                  maximizing the case's financial outcome. As your medical
                  treatment progresses, we advise you on keeping detailed
                  records of symptoms, treatment dates, and costs incurred by
                  you. We also let you know what you need to do to document an
                  ongoing lost-wage claim. Finally, in this stage of the case,
                  we ensure you are well-informed on the potential impact that
                  gaps in treatment may have on your case.

                  attorney and our team prepare a demand package. This
                  correspondence, sent directly to an insurance company or a
                  defendant, includes a detailed account of the
                  accident/incident, an assessment of damages, and a demanded
                  settlement amount. We typically allow for a 30-day response to
                  this demand letter. Throughout the negotiation process, we
                  remain transparent with you, discussing any offers from the
                  other party and explaining how those offers align with your
                  expectations and case value. Our goal here is to advocate
                  aggressively for a settlement that meets your financial needs
                  and reflects the full extent of your injuries and losses.
