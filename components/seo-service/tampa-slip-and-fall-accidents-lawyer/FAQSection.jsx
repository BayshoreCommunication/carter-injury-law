      question: "What Should I Do Immediately After a Slip and Fall Accident?",
      answer: "Report the fall to the property owner or manager before leaving and get a written copy of the incident report. Photograph the scene and any visible injuries, see a doctor the same day, and reach out to Carter Injury Law as soon as you can. The earlier an attorney gets involved, the stronger the case tends to be.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I Recover Compensation if I Was Partly Responsible for My Fall?",
      answer: "Florida follows a modified comparative negligence rule. You can still recover compensation if you're found to be 50% or less at fault, though the amount will be reduced in proportion to your share of responsibility. An attorney can evaluate how that rule applies to your specific situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What Evidence Helps Prove a Slip and Fall Claim?",
      answer: "Surveillance footage showing the hazard and the fall, maintenance logs and inspection records showing the owner had prior knowledge, the written incident report, witness contact information, and complete medical records from the date of injury forward all contribute to a well-supported premises liability claim in Florida.",
